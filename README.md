This repo is a collection of useful Unity scripts, created by 7 Days modders and others.  See comments in each script for author and contributor information.

Stubs Directory:  This directory contains various "Stub" scripts that can be placed onto entities in Unity to enable that script to work in game even though the script is stripped during the export process.   For a stub to work it ust link to the class in the assembly.

AnimationHierarchyEditor:  This is a copy of a script that allows you to adjust the hierarchy in an animation to match a different rig.

MultiPlatformExportAssetBundles:  Latest version of the script that creates Unity3d files for use in the game.

PrefabPrep.cs:  1 click preparation of humanoid characters for use in game.  This replaces the several scripts previous used to prepare characters.
